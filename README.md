# StreamSync: Synchronized Video Streaming Platform

StreamSync is a real-time synchronized video streaming platform that ensures all viewers watch the exact same content simultaneously, regardless of when they join. It consists of a Flask backend and Next.js frontend.

## Key Components

**Backend (Flask)**:
- Video processing service that segments videos into HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) format
- Global stream management with precise microsecond timing
- User identity and stream tracking system
- CDN-compatible caching for optimized delivery

**Frontend (Next.js)**:
- Responsive web interface with React components
- Advanced video player with frame-drop prevention
- Real-time synchronization system with server offset calculation
- Automatic recovery mechanisms for network issues

## How It Works

1. **Video Processing**:
   - Videos are uploaded and automatically segmented into HLS format
   - Thumbnails are generated for preview
   - Adaptive streaming with multiple quality levels

2. **Stream Synchronization**:
   - Server tracks exact start time of global streams
   - Clients calculate time offset between their local time and server time
   - VideoPlayer component enforces strict synchronization with configurable thresholds

3. **Playback Control**:
   - Seeking is disabled to maintain synchronization
   - Automatic recovery from stalled playback
   - Frame drop prevention through GPU acceleration and buffer management
   - Visual indicators for synchronization status

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Hardware acceleration for rendering
   - Dynamic buffer management based on network conditions
   - Precise timing with requestAnimationFrame for smoother playback
   - Multiple strategies for maintaining sync while minimizing interruptions

## Features

1. **Global Synchronization**:
   - All viewers see the same content at the exact same time
   - Server-driven timing with millisecond precision

2. **Robust Playback**:
   - Automatic recovery from network issues
   - Buffer health monitoring to prevent stalling
   - Smooth adjustment strategies to avoid jarring changes

3. **Multi-Stream Support**:
   - Users can choose between different streams
   - Each stream maintains its own synchronization

4. **Optimized Delivery**:
   - HLS format for adaptive bitrate streaming
   - CDN-compatible for global scale
   - Efficient caching of stream segments

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Synchronization**:
   - WebRTC integration for ultra-low latency
   - P2P delivery for reduced server load
   - AI-powered predictive buffering

2. **Advanced Content Management**:
   - Scheduled playlists with automatic transitions
   - Dynamic content based on viewer preferences
   - Live stream integration alongside pre-recorded content

3. **Interactive Features**:
   - Synchronized reactions and comments
   - Polls and quizzes tied to specific moments in videos
   - Shared drawing/annotation capabilities

4. **Analytics and Monitoring**:
   - Detailed playback performance metrics
   - Geographic distribution of viewers
   - Quality of experience tracking

5. **Mobile Applications**:
   - Native iOS/Android apps using the same synchronization engine
   - Push notifications for stream events
   - Background audio mode

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
